        <h2>HTML</h2>
          <p>HTML is code used to structure your webpage. The way it is structured is by using things called "Elements".</p>
          <p>But what are elements?</p>
          <p>Elements are keywords or letters used to help define how you want text or images to be structured on your webpage.</p>
          <p>What are some of these HTML elements?</p>
          <h3>Types of HTML elements</h3>
            <p>A quick list of elements commonly used and what they are used for</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
              <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
              <li>The meta element is used to define different characteristics used for a webpage, such as charset, which sets the types of
            characters that the webpage will be using.</li>
              <li>The p element is used to create a line of text without any special function</li>
              <li>The h1,h2,h3,h4,h5 and h6 elements are used to structure your webpage using differently sized and bolded text.
                You should only ever have 1 h1 element on a webpage as that is to be used to introduce your page.</li>
